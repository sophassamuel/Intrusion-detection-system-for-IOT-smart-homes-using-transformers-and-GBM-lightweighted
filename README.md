# Intrusion Detection System for IoT Smart Homes

## Overview

This project implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for IoT smart homes using Transformers and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM). The system is designed to analyze data from IoT devices to detect potential intrusions or security threats in a smart home environment. It utilizes lightweight models for efficient and real-time detection.
